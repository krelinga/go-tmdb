The British series was inspired by the Lonely Planet travelbooks and began airing in 1994. Globe Trekker is broadcast in over 40 countries across six continents.\n\nEach episode features a host, called a traveller, who travels with a camera crew to a country—often, a relatively exotic locale—and experiences the sights, sounds, and culture that the location has to offer. Special episodes feature in-depth city, beach, dive, shopping, history, festival, and food guides.\n\nThe show often goes far beyond popular tourist destinations in order to give viewers a more authentic look at local culture. Presenters usually participate in different aspects of regional life, such as attending a traditional wedding or visiting a mining community. They address the viewer directly, acting as tourists-turned-tour guides, but are also filmed interacting with locals and discovering interesting locations in unrehearsed sequences. Globe Trekker also sometimes includes brief interviews with backpackers who share tips on independent travel in that particular country.","popularity":14.6366,"poster_path":"/hMP8XLI1QFqJdeZ6fz78RdWniYE.jpg","first_air_date":"1994-12-31","name":"Globe Trekker","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":6},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/dYP7g2vYY5L1FyZzgEETF9eeU3r.jpg","genre_ids":[10765,10759],"id":82491,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Star Trek: Short Treks","overview":"Each episode tells a stand-alone story that serves as an opportunity for deeper storytelling and exploration of key characters and themes that fit into Star Trek: Discovery and the expanding Star Trek universe.","popularity":6.0313,"poster_path":"/1IMhBaY9PyjV2QlBa4tVe3W8EQi.jpg","first_air_date":"2018-10-03","name":"Star Trek: Short Treks","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":90},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/nbuE6gyskp6J5HRYaDrY9ZPLVqD.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":222309,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Extreme Treks","overview":"Join Ryan again on his most recent Extreme Treks series.

Set after the end of Hidden Frontier, Odyssey follows the USS Odyssey as it struggles to get home from a dangerous mission that has taken it and her crew 2.5 million light years from home... to the unknowns of the Andromeda Galaxy. This is the first Star Trek series, fan produced or otherwise, to take place outside of our own Earth''s galaxy.\n\nThe pilot for Odyssey, entitled Iliad, was put to wide release on Saturday, September 22, 2007 and is now freely available on the official website.\n\nAccording to the creator of Hidden Frontier and Odyssey, Rob Caves, Odyssey will be primarily centered around Lt. Cmdr. Ro Nevin in a loose retelling of Homer''s classic story of The Odyssey, set in the 24th century universe of Star Trek.\n\nRo was involved in numerous episodes of the Star Trek: Hidden Frontier series, and was in the first gay plotlines during the second season of Hidden Frontier. Caves has said that although Ro is an openly gay/bisexual character, the new series \"will focus instead on new aspects of his evolving persona that have not been explored yet in Hidden Frontier\".","popularity":2.8327,"poster_path":"/bX2tZrhEt8noxDQVw2hOXaRAgsN.jpg","first_air_date":"2007-09-01","name":"Star Trek: Odyssey","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":4},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/3LWAdtoKksNX9Crr7vD8hszQPS0.jpg","genre_ids":[16,18,10765],"id":1992,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Star Trek","overview":"The animated adventures of Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock and the crew of the Starship Enterprise.","popularity":8.8939,"poster_path":"/kvWG0bsLVQt23gZO6DI1mPosLxZ.jpg","first_air_date":"1973-09-08","name":"Star Trek","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":142},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/jPgGWo8z7dwDcnKZ0OzFTYZcHbB.jpg","genre_ids":[16,35,10765],"id":249278,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Star Trek: very Short Treks","overview":"From the mind of Casper Kelly (Too Many Cooks, Star Trek: Short Treks), Star Trek: very Short Treks celebrates the bold, the silly, and the unusual across the animated universe of Star Trek.","popularity":3.3036,"poster_path":"/sMkx1MoLbs1JBt9ICbNsXs8vBzu.jpg","first_air_date":"2023-09-08","name":"Star Trek: very Short Treks","vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/xxV8JrCdAyV9nqTn5OrJSA9Q0DN.jpg","genre_ids":[10767],"id":74141,"origin_country":[],"original_language":"en","original_name":"After Trek","overview":"The ultimate weekly forum for Star Trek fans with in-depth discussions and recaps of the latest Star Trek: Discovery episode.","popularity":0.1979,"poster_path":"/wHOKsvEfH7JynNcZT6owDtdL70u.jpg","first_air_date":"2017-09-24","name":"After Trek","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/4ePsv8kpSol0oXZEsDQMCibmncr.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":38282,"origin_country":["NO"],"original_language":"no","original_name":"Trekant","overview":"","popularity":0.8182,"poster_path":"/32G6grTtQVFYXzOnf4cHskdCbpK.jpg","first_air_date":"2010-11-03","name":"Trekant","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[99],"id":274672,"origin_country":["CZ"],"original_language":"cs","original_name":"Nejkrásnější treky Evropy","overview":"","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/x1XqJnx68v0zNY68vIYn17jv80X.jpg","first_air_date":"2024-09-05","name":"Nejkrásnější treky Evropy","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/iBmwAMaeBkCPl57igTM8FrVhyMs.jpg","genre_ids":[99],"id":102369,"origin_country":["FR"],"original_language":"fr","original_name":"Les plus beaux treks","overview":"","popularity":1.2385,"poster_path":"/l7pM4kmK03XRLGoDycNVNwy8czG.jpg","first_air_date":"2018-04-06","name":"Les plus beaux treks","vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[],"id":15950,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Star Trek: The Helena Chronicles","overview":"Star Trek: The Helena Chronicles is a fan film series, a spin-off from Star Trek: Hidden Frontier and companion series to Star Trek: Odyssey.
